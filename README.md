# WEB182 - PHP Programming
Assignments for the Web 182 PHP Programming class

Referencing examples in Chapters 5 & 6, you will learn how to build and debug an MVC patterned application. This will require you to:

    Use phpMyAdmin to create three tables in your MySQL WEB182 database on the wcet.waketech.edu server
    Modify PHP files to implement an MVC application which works with your MySQL database
    Upload the folder of application files (using your FTP application of choice - such as FileZilla) to your WEB182 directory on the wcet.waketech.edu server

Instructions
1. Use phpMyAdmin to create three tables in your MySQL WEB182 database (1)

    Download the attached exercise5-1-create-db.sql file.
    Open phpMyAdmin on the wcet.waketech.edu server (opens in a new window) [Plain text: http://wcet.waketech.edu/phpmyadmin]
    Login to the MySQL server using your database user ID and password.
    After logging in, you should see the database web182 + first five letters of your last name in the left panel.  Click on this database to select it.
    Click on the Import tab and follow the instructions from Figure 3-10 (p. 115) of the textbook to import the exercise5-1-create-db.sql file.

2. Modify the PHP files to implement an MVC application which will work with your MySQL database

    Download the attached ch05_ex1.zip file. Expand it. (2)
    In the ch05_ex1 folder, in the model folder, open the database.php file. Modify it to connect to your database. (3)
    Follow the instructions in Exercise 5-1 (pp. 189-190) to enhance the Product Manager application and to refactor the Product Catalog application.

3. Upload your ch05_ex1 folder to the wcet.waketech.edu server
4. Test your application to make sure it is working properly. Include the following for this assignment submission:

    A clickable URL to your PHP file on wcet.waketech.edu (4)
    A zipped copy of your project files.
    A short paragraph describing your experience. Did you encounter problems? Did it seem confusing? What aspects?

Do not wait until the last minute to start this assignment! - You're being given two weeks because MVC architecture is one of the more challenging concepts to understand and master! Aim to have this complete by the end of the first week, then use the extra week to ask questions and debug! You'll probably need it!  
Notes:
(1) Refer to the Textbook, Software, & Wake Tech Server Access course link at the bottom of this lesson for details on Accessing MySQL on the Wake Tech Student Server.
(2) w3schools is an excellent resource for HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL questions. 3wschools (opens in a new window) [Plain text: https://www.w3schools.com/] You may find the PHP MySQL Database topic (opens in a new window) especially helpful [Plain text: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_intro.asp]
(3) Your MySQL database for this course will be named web182 + first five letters of your last name. For example, John Public's database would be web182publi. Your username and password will be the same as your FTP account on the server. Also, be sure to use "localhost" - NOT the IP address - when referring to the server host_address.
(4) Your URL should look similar to this: https://wcet.waketech.edu/your_user_account/web182/lesson3-4/ch05_ex1/index.php.
