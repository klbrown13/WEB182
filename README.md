Add the following validation features :

        Change the file name for index.html to index.php
        Add PHP code to index.php to display an error message named $error_message just below the page heading.  Be sure to check that $error_message is not an empty value.  Format it to be bold, red text.
        Display error messages if the Product Description, List Price and Discount Percent fields are empty after the user submits the form. (1)
        Display an error message if the List Price or Discount Percent data entered is not a number after the user submits the form.
        Display an error message if the List Price or Discount Percent data entered is less than zero after the user submits the form.
        If an error message is displayed, take the user back to the index.php page.
        Add a sales tax calculation of 8% based on the discounted price. Then, display the sales tax rate and the calculated sales tax amount after the discounted price.

Upload the ch02_ex1 directory (including all files) to your student account on the Wake Tech web server. (2)
Test your page to make sure it is working properly.
Submit the URL for your page. (3)
Notes:
(1) PHP treats the zero as an empty value in this situation, which is why the example gives you the "required field" message. This is documented in the PHP documentation (opens in new window) [Plain text: http://php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php]. This is one of those situations where the "looseness" of PHP code can be a bit misleading. There are other ways to get more accurate results, but for now please follow the instructions above.
(2) Refer to the Textbook, Software, & Wake Tech Server Access course link at the bottom of this lesson.
(3) Your URL should look similar to this: https://wcet.waketech.edu/your_user_account/web182/lesson1/ch02_ex1/index.php.
