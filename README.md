# WEB182 - PHP Programming
Assignments for the Web 182 PHP Programming class


Background

In the previous assignment (L8A), we enhanced the Future Value application from Chapter 2 to use a PHP persistent session.
For this assignment, we're going to work with a new version of the Future Value application - one which has been rewritten to use PHP objects.
Using what you learned in Chapter 14, you are going to find (6) errors in the supplied files for this new, object oriented Future Value application.
Instructions
1. Using the attached example files, install the new, object oriented version of the Future Value application (originally described on pp. 80-87 of your textbook. (Remember, this is a complete, working PHP application.) (1)
2. A total of (6) errors have been found in the files you have been given. Your challenge for this assignment is to find and correct those problems so that the application runs without throwing PHP errors or providing incorrect calculations. To help narrow down your search for the bad (or missing) code, here are the (6) problems you need to address:
index.php 

    Incorrect logic was applied in a conditional test which causes a PHP fatal error on page load
    A coding mistake which - when the "calculate" button is pressed - causes the following page to be blank

display_results.php

    A coding mistake which causes a PHP fatal error to occur when executing line 15
    An omission which causes the incorrect number of years to be used & displayed

future_value.php

    A coding mistake which causes a PHP fatal error to occur when executing line 46 of display_results.php 
    A coding mistake which - when “Compound Interest Monthly” is selected - causes a wrong future value calculation (2)

3. Upload your ch014_l9a folder to the wcet.waketech.edu server
4. Test your application to make sure it is working properly. Include the following for this assignment submission:

    A clickable URL to your PHP file on wcet.waketech.edu (3)
    Your project files.

Notes:
(1) *** Note: DO NOT use the starting or final files we used in Lesson 8. DO use the files contained in ch14_l9a.zip attached to this assignment. ***
(2) Example: the Future Value for $10k, compounded monthly @ 4% for 3 yrs is $11,272.72, not $10,100.33 as shown.
(3) Your URL should look similar to this: https://wcet.waketech.edu/your_user_account/web182/lesson9/ch11_l9a/index.php.
