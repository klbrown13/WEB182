Background
For this assignment, we're going to combine two applications presented in the book.
Instructions
1. On pages 504-515 the Registration application (short version) is presented. You have access to download the code presented on these pages. On pages 516-517 the long version of the Registration application is discussed. You also have access to download this code as well.
2. Your challenge for this week is to complete (2) tasks:

     Add the code for the Password & Verify Password fields (you need to include them both) from the long version of the Registration application to the short version (this includes the validation code as well)
    Modify the code according to the instructions 15-1, step 5, on page 519 of your book
    ("... In the password() method of the Validate class, modify the code so the password must be at least 8 characters long with at least one uppercase letter and one number. Don't require a lower case letter or a special character.")

3. Upload your ch15_register_short folder to the wcet.waketech.edu server
4. Test your application to make sure it is working properly. Include the following for this assignment submission:

    A clickable URL to your PHP file on wcet.waketech.edu (1)
    Your project files.

Notes:
(1) Your URL should look similar to this: https://wcet.waketech.edu/your_user_account/web182/lesson10/ch15_register_short/index.php.
